Send email using python and csv file
-------------------------------------

To run : 
	
	1. Create a config.py file and store your gmail username and password as:

		GMAIL_USERNAME = < your email >
		GMAIL_PASSWORD = < your gmail password >

	2. Put your csv file inside the main directory. 

	   Note : In this case i am using slack csv file and so the email is available at the second position of each entry or row.
	   For a different csv file, this index may change accordingly.

	   Make changes in the csv_reader.py file i.e change the email_index to the required index of your csv file email field.

	3. Run the code

		python main.py < name of the csv file >
